I am not sure how many times I wanted to start a blog, and without realising it has been postponed for many years. 
I know I have to start from somewhere, if not let's just forget all about this whole idea. 

To be honest, I had several blogs before this, but like any other dreams they were all buried without any updates.

The lesson: it's not easy for me to get here and I am happy to announce this post is my first step to get into blogging world for real.

I have given lots of thoughts regarding what kind of blog I should create. My first intention of having this blog is to write only on Japan. I do not think that's a great idea. So, it will be anything and everything I find interesting.

I always find Japan fascinating and I want to share with people what I have studied and learnt about the country. I hope this blog will be useful and informative to everyone who also finds Japan amazing.

That's the idea!
