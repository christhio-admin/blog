Konbini Gaikokujin (Convenience Store Foreigner) is a book by Kensuke Serizawa. The book, which was published in May 2018, is about stories of non-Japanese working at convenience stores in Japan. I knew about this book from an article on Japan Times and decided to purchase it afterwards.

This post summarises the first chapter of the book. <span style="color:red">It's advisable to read from the original source since my understanding and interpretation could possibly deviate from what the author wanted to convey</span>. Hence correction is always welcome.

Foreigners who are working at convenience stores are increasing in Japan. It has also become a common sight for them to be featured in TV commercials and convenience stores' homepage.

**Maximum 28 hours each week**

As a general rule, overseas students in Japan could work part-time up to 28 hours per week. During summer vacation, students could work up to eight hours per day and forty hours in a week. Both employer and employee could be penalised if they break this rule.

Take for example if an hour pay is 1000円, in one month people can earn maximum 112,000円. Lodging room for university students on average cost under 30,000円 per month.

Currently, many overseas students coming to Japan are in debt. They are studying Japanese language and at the same time working part-time to get student visa in order to enter Japan. 

In the first year, they have to pay school and other fees which easily exceed one million yen. It is natural for students from countries with average monthly income like 20,000円 to 30,000円 to get into debt. Foreign nationals on student visas would get repatriated, if they could not pay school fees from second year onwards.

**Why are they working at convenience stores?**

Many foreign-born convenience store young workers in Tokyo mentioned it was due to labour shortage. "It's fine even if you don't speak much Japanese language" was also mentioned a lot.

Almost all of foreign nationals working part-time at convenience stores are students who attend Japanese language schools, vocational colleges and technical colleges. It is rare for university students and graduate students to work part-time at convenience stores, even for Japanese university students.

**Japan's dependence on one million foreign labour**

Based on the data released by Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in October 2017, out of approximately 270,000 overseas students in Japan, around 260,000 are working part-time.

Since 2016 foreign labour in Japan has exceeded one million. 30.2% are working in manufacturing industry (mostly are from technical intern training programme), 13% are working in wholesale and retail business (this includes convenience stores and supermarkets), and 12.3% are working in accomodation and food & beverage services.

That means since many foreign nationals are working in different types of businesses, Japan has become dependent on foreign manpower.
