Konbini Gaikokujin (Convenience Store Foreigner) is a book by Kensuke Serizawa. The book, which was published in May 2018, is about stories of non-Japanese working at convenience stores in Japan. I knew about this book from an article on Japan Times and decided to purchase it afterwards.

This post summarises the first chapter of the book. <span style="color:red">It's advisable to read from the original source since my understanding and interpretation might be incorrect</span>. Hence correction is always welcome.

Foreigners working at convenience stores keep increasing in Japan. It has also become a common sight for them to be featured in TV commercials and convenience stores' homepage.

**Maximum 28 hours each week**

As a general rule, overseas students in Japan could work part-time up to 28 hours per week. During summer vacation, students could work up to eight hours per day and forty hours in a week. Both employer and employee could be penalised if they break this rule.

Take for example if an hour pay is 1000円, in one month people can earn maximum 112,000円. Lodging room for university students costs under 30,000円 per month on average.

Currently, many overseas students coming to Japan are in debt. They are studying Japanese language and at the same time working part-time to get student visa in order to enter Japan. 

In the first year, they have to pay school and other fees which easily exceed one million yen. It is natural for students from countries with average monthly income like 20,000円 to 30,000円 to get into debt. Foreign nationals on student visas would get repatriated, if they could not pay school fees from second year onwards.

**Why are they working at convenience stores?**

Many foreign-born convenience store young workers in Tokyo mentioned it was due to labour shortage. Another common cited reason is "It's fine even if you don't speak much Japanese language".

Almost all of foreign nationals working part-time at convenience stores are students who attend Japanese language schools, vocational colleges and technical colleges. It is rare for university students and graduate students to work part-time at convenience stores, even for Japanese university students.

**Japan's dependence on one million foreign labour**

Based on the data released by Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in October 2017, out of approximately 270,000 overseas students in Japan, around 260,000 are working part-time.

Since 2016 foreign labour in Japan has exceeded one million people. With 30.2% are working in manufacturing industry (mostly are from technical intern training programme), 13% are working in wholesale and retail business (this includes convenience stores and supermarkets), and 12.3% are working in accomodation and food & beverage services.

That means since many foreign nationals are working in different types of businesses, Japan has become dependent on foreign manpower.

**Moreover foreign residents keep increasing**

As of June 2017, there were 2,471,458 foreigners residing in Japan, which include overseas students working at convenience stores, permanent residents, technical trainees, people regardless of objectives and motives, and mid-to-long term foreign residents. In total, they made up of 196 nationalities.

From 2008 until 2012, Japan experiences a downward trend in foreign resident population. It has been steadily increasing since then. And the highest growth recorded for the number of foreign residents is 6.7% between 2015 and 2016.

**Rapid increase of Nepalis and Vietnamese people**

Most foreign residents in Japan come from Brazil (7.5%) or Asian countries, particularly China (28.8%), South Korea (18.3%), the Philippines (10.2%), Vietnam (9.4%), and Nepal (3%).

While Korean population is declining in Japan, the number of Nepalis and Vietnamese people are almost doubled in the last three years. 

**Vietnam's Japanese language boom**

Ho Chi Minh and Hanoi are now bristled with Japanese language schools. Japanese language also became the first foreign language to be taught to primary school students in Vietnam since 2016.

The reason why people want to go to Japan is not because they want to learn about Japanese culture, but it is to earn money, I think. *(Minh-kun)*
